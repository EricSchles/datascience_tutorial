# Data Science Bootcamp

Today we are going to start on an endeavor together.  The goal of this endeavor is to save science.  One person at a time.  And we are going to start together.  I want to start by talking about a preception held by some in our community and offer a reaction as well as context.  

## Starting with right now

Recently there was a blog post that went around.  If you didn't see it when it went up.  It went something like this:

"Deep learning is cool.  Just focus on algorithms.  Data cleaning, experimental design and everything else is useless!  Don't even learn those skills."

This post informs the rest of what I'm going to talk about for the coming bootcamps.  I want to make sure that the above statement is not a thing you think.  And I want to make sure you come with me on this journey.  

## Learning Objectives

Now you can just take my word for it, that the things I'll be teaching you are better.  But I don't think that's going to cut it.  So we are going to talk through what you will get out of this course and why it's important:

1.  The ability to handle vaguely defined problems and come up with real solutions.  This is the core of science.  The ability to handle no requirements or structure and come up with systems that literally change the entire world.  Not every scientific experiment will yield a break through.  But!  Some will.  Some experiments will change everything we know about the world.  Because the true power of science, is the ability to uncover truth.  And when something is true, you can make assumptions based on it.  This will come to us in the form of deciding whether or not a project is worth doing.  And it will be honed by developing scientific skepticism.

2.  The ability to communicate science and weave a narative.  It is as important that you are able to communicate your results as it is that you find them.  The power of science is that you learn something that is true.  You should assume that the people around you will be as skeptical if not more so than you need to be.  And therefore convincing them should tell a powerful story.  One in which you are certain of your results and can convince others of that certainty.

3.  Work with engineers to develop a system around your discovery or set of discoveries.  If we cannot go to production then our discovery is important, but useless from a business context.  Therefore, our goal ought to be to be able to work with engineers to get our thing built, once we've gotten our results.

## Story Time - A brief history of machine learning

Science is really hard to do.  And in a sense, the formal process of science hasn't been with us for that long.  Only really since the 1200s.  That seems like a long time, but establishing the scientific foundation and main streaming it took a very long time.  Even now, science is not completely accepted by everyone.  Many scientific results are questioned, even when they can be proven empathtically.  Compared with the span of human history, the scientific process is very new.  And we are still wrapping our heads around it.

Additionally, computer science and software engineering is even newer.  We are still solving computational problems and just getting to the basics of main streaming.  Just now is a computational education starting to be required by schools prior to college.  And we are absolutely still trying to figure it out.

The story of trying to combine machine learning and software engineering is as old as computer science itself.  Alan Turing famously contemplated this very challenge.  And in fact, throughout the history of computer science, you can see moments when folks believed that machine learning, sometimes by other names, could be part of a computational system.  However, each surge of interest led to another surge of disillusionment.  And we entered a period called the AI winter.  I fear another winter is coming.  But it doesn't half to!  Some folks think it's because AI will fail on some edge cases.  Some think it's because statistical systems are impractical and don't really work.  And some think like I do, that it's because we've thrown the science out of data science.  

So that's where we are going to start today.  With learning how to be skeptical.
